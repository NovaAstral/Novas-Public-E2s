#This isn't a good way to do this anymore as chat events exist and are far better

runOnChat(1)
#This makes the e2 trigger whenever someone sends a message in chat

OLS = owner():lastSaid():lower() #the lower() makes it case in-sensitive (eg: /cHaT tEsT would work)
#This makes it easier for multiple commands so you don't have to type it every time


if(chatClk(owner())){
    if(OLS == "/chat test"){ #This is what you say in chat to trigger this. the code must be in lowercase
                #the / is so that it doesn't show up in chat if you mess up the command on TSCM

        print("Chat test succesful")
        #Print only prints to the owners chat
        #Don't use botSay(), that outputs to the entire faction       
    }
}
