#This is a small tutorial on how to make buttons in EGP

#You can also use the User input to lock it so only a certain person can use it like:
# if(~User & User & User == owner())

if(~User & User){
    #This detects when someone presses E on the screen, and doesn't require interval() or a timer
    
    local Cursor = EGP:egpCursor(User)
    #This is where the player is aiming when they press E
    
    if(inrange(Cursor,vec2(50,50),vec2(100,100))){
        #This activates if the player is looking inside this square when they press E
        
        A = 1 #this is where you do stuff
    }
    
    else{ #This sets A to 0 if they're not looking inside the square when they press E (optional)
        A = 0
    }
}
